# Sparse-Array
In some applications, we might want to represent an array with numerous indices (e.g. 10^8), however, most of it are just zeros (e.g. 95%)
Creating such huge arrays is very time & memory harmful with no return a better idea is to represent such arrays using a linked list which represents a sparse array.
